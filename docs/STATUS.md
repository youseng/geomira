# STATUS

## Run 0: NOT ACCEPTED

Scaffold and guardrails. Everything is in place and green locally, in a clean clone and in
CI (ci, tex, deploy and nightly all succeeded on commit 76fb8bd); the one open criterion
is the GitHub Pages deployment itself, which only runs on the default branch (see
"Not done").

Starting point: no previous run, no `run-*` tag, no docs/adr/, no package.json, so there
was no `pnpm verify` to run and no red base to repair. This run creates both.

## Done (each item → the test file that proves it)

1. pnpm workspace per SPEC §2: packages num, kernel, claims, lang, scene, editor, export
   (each exports only `VERSION`) and apps/web (Vite + React + TypeScript). Shared
   tsconfig.base.json: strict, noUncheckedIndexedAccess, exactOptionalPropertyTypes (plus
   noImplicitReturns, noUnusedLocals/Parameters, verbatimModuleSyntax). Package `src/` is
   compiled with `lib: ES2022` and `types: []` (no DOM, no Node globals).
   → `packages/*/test/index.test.ts` (exports exactly `VERSION`, equal to package.json).
2. ESLint 10 (typescript-eslint strictTypeChecked, `@vitest/eslint-plugin`
   no-disabled-tests / no-focused-tests, ban on `.skip/.only/.todo/.fails/.skipIf/.runIf`
   in tests, purity bans in `packages/*/src`: Math.random, Date, performance, window,
   document, process, timers, module-level `let`/`var`, module-level Map/Set caches,
   react/react-dom/zustand and `node:*` imports; no `any`; no `as` casts outside tests;
   eslint-disable comments need a description), Prettier, dependency-cruiser generated
   from the SPEC §2 table, Vitest `test.projects`, Playwright in apps/web.
   → `scripts/lint-guards.test.ts`, `scripts/depcruise.test.ts` (all 42 ordered package
   pairs: exactly the SPEC-forbidden ones are flagged; Node built-ins and npm imports in
   pure packages flagged, lz-string allowed in editor; packages → apps flagged).
3. `pnpm rules` (scripts/check-rules.ts, rules in scripts/check-rules/), each rule with
   bad/good fixtures under scripts/check-rules/fixtures/:
   - (a) tolerance-like literals → `scripts/check-rules/tolerance.test.ts`
   - (b) files > 400 lines → `scripts/check-rules/file-length.test.ts`
   - (c) test count below docs/test-count.txt → `scripts/check-rules/test-count.test.ts`
   - (d) disabled/focused/todo/expected-failure tests → `scripts/check-rules/disabled-tests.test.ts`
   - (e) add-only guard → `scripts/check-rules/add-only.test.ts` (throwaway git repos:
     modified line, deleted line, deleted file, uncommitted change, missing ADR, one of
     several commits without ADR, version-ordered tags, shallow clone all fail; added
     lines and ADR-cited commits pass)
   - (f) proved/proof/proven → `scripts/check-rules/forbidden-words.test.ts`
   - CLI exit code and report → `scripts/check-rules/cli.test.ts`
4. `pnpm verify` = typecheck + lint (ESLint + Prettier) + depcruise + rules + test.
5. Workflows: `ci.yml` (install, verify, build, Playwright), `tex.yml` (GHCR-cached Debian
   image with texlive-latex-base, texlive-pictures, texlive-latex-extra, asymptote;
   compiles tests/fixtures/hello-tikz.tex and hello.asy and checks Asymptote's `write()`
   output), `deploy.yml` (build with base `/<repo>/`, base-path check, Playwright under
   that base, Pages artifact, deploy job on the default branch), `nightly.yml` (test
   suite with NIGHTLY=1, daily and on changes to the workflow).
6. apps/web renders "Geomira" and an empty canvas → `apps/web/test/App.test.tsx`,
   `apps/web/e2e/shell.spec.ts` (desktop and 390×664, no page errors, canvas > 100 px).
7. docs/STATUS.md (this file), docs/adr/0001-baseline.md, docs/test-count.txt (73).
8. Clean clone in a temp directory: `git clone` → `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` →
   `pnpm verify` → `pnpm build` → `pnpm e2e`, all exit 0 (output below).

## Not done

- **GitHub Pages deployment not yet exercised.** The deploy workflow is green on this
  branch, but only its `build` job ran (build with base `/geomira/`, base-path check,
  Playwright under the base path, Pages artifact upload). The `deploy` job runs only on
  the default branch and was skipped. Whether Pages is enabled for the repository could
  not be checked from this session. Run 0 becomes ACCEPTED once the deploy job is green
  on the default branch (see Requests).
- `run-0` tag not created (it marks an ACCEPTED run; see Requests).

## Known bugs

None known.

## Uncertain

- No mathematical content in this run.
- Rule (a) is a textual check, as CLAUDE.md describes it ("greps for float literals"):
  it scans comments and strings too, and it does not catch tolerances written as
  expressions (for example a power of two with a negative exponent). Rule (f) uses a
  word match with camelCase boundaries; `improved`, `waterproof`, `provenance` are not
  hits, `unproven` and `isProven` are.
- Rule (d) bans the six test modifiers anywhere in code, as CLAUDE.md says
  ("anywhere"). A future method named `skip` (for example in a lexer) would have to be
  named differently.

## Changed frozen tests

None (no `run-*` tag existed).

### Every check-rules fixture fails as intended

The fixture tests above assert the exact `file:line` list of each bad tree and an empty
list for each good tree. The same trees through the real CLI
(`tsx scripts/check-rules.ts scripts/check-rules/fixtures/<rule>/bad`; every run exits 1;
test-count also fails there because a fixture tree has no floor file):

```

test-count.test.ts and add-only.test.ts (all cases listed under Done).

### TeX fixtures (local, Ubuntu 24.04 TeX Live + Asymptote 2.87)

`sh tests/fixtures/compile-tex.sh` → hello-tikz.pdf written, Asymptote prints `(2,0)`,
"TeX and Asymptote fixtures compiled.", exit 0. With the expected coordinate changed to
`(9,9)` the script exits 1.

### CI on GitHub (commit 76fb8bd, branch claude/run-0-scaffold-guardrails-crjyx4)

In tex.yml the compile job ran inside `ghcr.io/youseng/geomira-tex`, wrote
hello-tikz.pdf, and Asymptote printed `(2,0)` ("TeX and Asymptote fixtures compiled.").
The commit that adds this STATUS.md re-runs ci and deploy; tex and nightly have path
filters (TeX inputs, their own workflow file) and run again only when those change or
on their schedule / manual dispatch.

| Workflow | Run                                                         | Result                                                         |

## Requests

- **Enable GitHub Pages** (Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions), merge this branch,
  and check that the `deploy` job of deploy.yml is green on the default branch; then
  Run 0 can be marked ACCEPTED.
- **Tag `run-0`** on the accepted commit on the default branch:
  `git tag run-0 <sha>` then `git push origin run-0`. From then on the add-only guard
  freezes every test file present at that tag. CI checks out full history (`fetch-depth: 0`) for this.
- Dependencies: none beyond the allowed runtime set (react, react-dom). Dev tooling only:
  TypeScript, ESLint + plugins, Prettier, dependency-cruiser, Vitest, Vite,
  @vitejs/plugin-react, Playwright, tsx, @types/\*, globals.
- Deviations from the run text (not from SPEC), recorded in ADR-0001: Vitest
  `test.projects` instead of a workspace file (removed in Vitest 4);
  `@vitest/eslint-plugin` instead of `eslint-plugin-vitest` (renamed package, same
  rules).
- The tex image is based on `public.ecr.aws/docker/library/debian:trixie-slim` (the
  official Debian image via ECR Public) to avoid Docker Hub rate limits; GHCR package
  `geomira-tex` is created by the first tex.yml run.
